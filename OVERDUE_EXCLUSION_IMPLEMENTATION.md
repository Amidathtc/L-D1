# OVERDUE SCHEDULES EXCLUSION - CLIENT REQUIREMENT

**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Requirement:** Client does not want to see OVERDUE repayment schedules in the table  
**Status:** ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED

---

## Change Summary

### What Changed

The default view of repayment schedules now **excludes OVERDUE schedules**.

**Before:**

- Default view showed: PENDING, PARTIAL, OVERDUE
- Client could see all unpaid schedules

**After:**

- Default view shows: PENDING, PARTIAL only
- OVERDUE schedules are hidden by default
- Client can still view OVERDUE if they explicitly filter by "Overdue" status

---

## Implementation Details

### File Modified

`L-Dash/app/dashboard/business-management/loan-payment/repayment-schedules/page.tsx`

### Changes Made

#### 1. Filter Logic (Line 923-940)

```typescript
// BEFORE
filtered = filtered.filter((item) =>
  ["PENDING", "PARTIAL", "OVERDUE"].includes((item.status || "").toUpperCase())
);

// AFTER
filtered = filtered.filter((item) =>
  ["PENDING", "PARTIAL"].includes((item.status || "").toUpperCase())
);
```

#### 2. Status Label (Line 1426)

```typescript
// BEFORE
PAYMENT STATUS :

// AFTER
PAYMENT STATUS (Default: Pending & Partial)
```

#### 3. Stats Card Label (Line 1218)

```typescript
// BEFORE
Today's Schedules

// AFTER
Active Schedules (Pending & Partial)
```

## How It Works

### Default View Behavior

```
User navigates to Repayment Schedules
    ‚Üì
Page loads with no status filter selected
    ‚Üì
Applied filter: ["PENDING", "PARTIAL"]
    ‚Üì
Table displays only:
  - PENDING schedules (not yet paid)
  - PARTIAL schedules (partially paid)
    ‚Üì
OVERDUE schedules are HIDDEN
```

### User Can Still See OVERDUE

If user clicks the "Overdue" button:

```
User clicks "Overdue" button
    ‚Üì
Filter applied: status === "OVERDUE"
    ‚Üì
Table displays only OVERDUE schedules
```

### User Can See PAID

If user clicks the "Paid" button:

```
User clicks "Paid" button
    ‚Üì
Filter applied: status === "PAID"
    ‚Üì
Table displays only PAID schedules
```

## User Experience

### Before Change

```
Default View shows:
‚îú‚îÄ PENDING items (awaiting payment)
‚îú‚îÄ PARTIAL items (partially paid)
‚îî‚îÄ OVERDUE items (late payments) ‚Üê Client didn't want this
```

### After Change

```
Default View shows:
‚îú‚îÄ PENDING items (awaiting payment)
‚îî‚îÄ PARTIAL items (partially paid)

OVERDUE items only shown if:
‚Üí User clicks "Overdue" filter button
```

---

## Available Status Filters

All status filters remain available:

| Filter Button | Shows            | Behavior                      |
| ------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------- |
| All Schedules | PENDING, PARTIAL | Default view (OVERDUE hidden) |
| Pending       | PENDING only     | Shows not-yet-paid items      |
| Partial       | PARTIAL only     | Shows partially-paid items    |
| Overdue       | OVERDUE only     | Shows late payments           |
| Paid          | PAID only        | Shows fully-paid items        |
