# REPAYMENT SCHEDULES FILTERING - CLIENT REQUIREMENTS

**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Requirements:**

1. Client does not want to see OVERDUE repayment schedules in the table
2. Only repayment schedules from today and forward should show (no past schedules)

**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED

---

## Change Summary

### What Changed

The repayment schedules table now has two filtering rules applied:

**Rule 1 - Status Filter:**

- Excludes OVERDUE schedules from default view
- Shows only PENDING and PARTIAL schedules

**Rule 2 - Date Filter:**

- Filters out all past repayment schedules
- Shows only schedules with due dates from today onwards
- Past schedules are completely hidden

**Before:**

- Default view showed: PENDING, PARTIAL, OVERDUE (including past dates)
- Client could see historical/past repayment schedules
- Could see payment schedules from previous dates

**After:**

- Default view shows: PENDING, PARTIAL only, from today forward
- All past repayment schedules are hidden
- Only future and today's schedules are displayed
- OVERDUE can still be viewed via explicit filter button
- But even OVERDUE will be from today onward

---

## Implementation Details

### File Modified

`L-Dash/app/dashboard/business-management/loan-payment/repayment-schedules/page.tsx`

### Changes Made

#### 1. Status Filter Logic (Line 923-940)

Excludes OVERDUE and shows only PENDING & PARTIAL by default:

```typescript
// BEFORE
filtered = filtered.filter((item) =>
  ["PENDING", "PARTIAL", "OVERDUE"].includes((item.status || "").toUpperCase())
);

// AFTER
filtered = filtered.filter((item) =>
  ["PENDING", "PARTIAL"].includes((item.status || "").toUpperCase())
);
```

#### 2. NEW: Date Filter - No Past Schedules (Line 941-953)

Filters out all past repayment schedules - only shows today and forward:

```typescript
// NEW FILTER ADDED
// Filter out past repayment schedules - only show today and forward
// Per client request: no past or previous repayment schedules should show
const today = startOfDay(new Date());
const beforeFilter = filtered.length;
filtered = filtered.filter((item) => {
  const dueDate = startOfDay(new Date(item.dueDate));
  const isPastSchedule = dueDate < today;
  return !isPastSchedule; // Exclude past schedules
});
console.log(
  `📅 After excluding past schedules: ${filtered.length} items (removed ${
    beforeFilter - filtered.length
  } past items)`
);
```

**How it works:**

- Gets today's date at 00:00:00
- Compares each schedule's due date
- Removes any schedule where dueDate < today
- Keeps all schedules with dueDate >= today

#### 3. Status Label (Line 1426)

```typescript
// BEFORE
PAYMENT STATUS :

// AFTER
PAYMENT STATUS (Default: Pending & Partial)
```

#### 4. Stats Card Label (Line 1218)

```typescript
// BEFORE
Today's Schedules

// AFTER
Active Schedules (Pending & Partial)
```

---

## How It Works

### Filtering Chain (Applied in order)

```
1. Status Filter: Keep only PENDING and PARTIAL
2. Date Filter: Remove all past schedules (dueDate < today)
3. User Filters: Apply any user-selected status filter
```

### Default View Behavior (Two Filters Applied)

```
User navigates to Repayment Schedules
    ↓
FILTER 1: Status Filter
  Applied: ["PENDING", "PARTIAL"]
  Excludes: OVERDUE, PAID
    ↓
FILTER 2: Date Filter
  Applied: dueDate >= today (00:00:00)
  Removes: All past schedules
    ↓
Result: Only PENDING and PARTIAL schedules from today onwards
    ↓
Table displays only:
  - PENDING schedules with dueDate >= today
  - PARTIAL schedules with dueDate >= today
    ↓
Hidden:
  - OVERDUE schedules (excluded by status filter)
  - PAID schedules (excluded by status filter)
  - Any past dates (excluded by date filter)
```

### User Can Still See OVERDUE (But Only From Today Onwards)

If user clicks the "Overdue" button:

```
User clicks "Overdue" button
    ↓
Status Filter Applied: status === "OVERDUE"
    ↓
Date Filter Still Applied: dueDate >= today
    ↓
Result: OVERDUE schedules from today onwards only
    ↓
Note: Past OVERDUE schedules are NOT shown
```

### User Can See PAID (But Only From Today Onwards)

If user clicks the "Paid" button:

```
User clicks "Paid" button
    ↓
Status Filter Applied: status === "PAID"
    ↓
Date Filter Still Applied: dueDate >= today
    ↓
Result: PAID schedules from today onwards only
    ↓
Note: Past PAID schedules are NOT shown
```

---

## User Experience

### Before Change

```
Default View shows:
├─ PENDING items (any date, including past)
├─ PARTIAL items (any date, including past)
└─ OVERDUE items (any date, including past)
    ↓
Client sees historical data from previous months/years
```

### After Change

```
Default View shows:
├─ PENDING items from today onwards
└─ PARTIAL items from today onwards

All other statuses and dates hidden:
├─ No OVERDUE items
├─ No PAID items
└─ No past dates

OVERDUE items only shown if:
→ User clicks "Overdue" filter button
  (Still only shows from today onwards)
```

### Timeline Example

```
Scenario: Today is October 20, 2025

Past Schedules (NOT shown):
  ├─ Oct 1: PENDING (hidden - date is past)
  ├─ Oct 5: PARTIAL (hidden - date is past)
  ├─ Oct 15: OVERDUE (hidden - date is past)
  └─ Oct 19: PAID (hidden - date is past)

Today & Future (SHOWN by default):
  ├─ Oct 20: PENDING ✓ (shown - today, PENDING status)
  ├─ Oct 20: PARTIAL ✓ (shown - today, PARTIAL status)
  ├─ Oct 22: PENDING ✓ (shown - future, PENDING status)
  ├─ Oct 25: PARTIAL ✓ (shown - future, PARTIAL status)
  ├─ Nov 1: PENDING ✓ (shown - future, PENDING status)
  └─ Nov 10: PARTIAL ✓ (shown - future, PARTIAL status)

If user filters to "Overdue":
  ├─ Oct 22: OVERDUE ✓ (shown - future, OVERDUE status)
  ├─ Oct 25: OVERDUE ✓ (shown - future, OVERDUE status)
  └─ Past OVERDUE items are still hidden
```

## Available Status Filters

All status filters remain available but now respect the date filter:

| Filter Button | Shows            | Date Range    | Behavior                           |
| ------------- | ---------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| All Schedules | PENDING, PARTIAL | Today onwards | Default view (OVERDUE hidden)      |
| Pending       | PENDING only     | Today onwards | Shows not-yet-paid items           |
| Partial       | PARTIAL only     | Today onwards | Shows partially-paid items         |
| Overdue       | OVERDUE only     | Today onwards | Shows late payments (future dates) |
| Paid          | PAID only        | Today onwards | Shows fully-paid items             |

**Important:** Even when filtering by status, past schedules are never shown.

## Query Examples

### API Calls Made

**Default View (No Filter):**

```
GET /api/repayments/schedules?page=1&limit=50
Returns: Mix of all statuses from all dates
Frontend filters to:
  1. Status: PENDING, PARTIAL only
  2. Date: dueDate >= today (00:00:00)
```

**When User Clicks Overdue:**

```
GET /api/repayments/schedules?page=1&limit=50&status=OVERDUE
Returns: Only OVERDUE schedules from all dates
Frontend filters to:
  1. Status: OVERDUE only (already filtered at API)
  2. Date: dueDate >= today (removes past OVERDUE items)
```

**When User Clicks Paid:**

```
GET /api/repayments/schedules?page=1&limit=50&status=PAID
Returns: Only PAID schedules from all dates
Frontend filters to:
  1. Status: PAID only (already filtered at API)
  2. Date: dueDate >= today (removes past PAID items)
```

**To Access Historical Data (Past Schedules):**

```
User manually sets date range filter in UI
(e.g., "Show past 30 days")
    ↓
GET /api/repayments/schedules?page=1&limit=50&dateFrom=past&dateTo=today
Returns: Schedules in that date range
Frontend applies:
  1. Status filter (PENDING/PARTIAL by default)
  2. Date range filter (user-selected range, not today-forward constraint)
    ↓
Historical data becomes visible
```

## Data Flow

```
API Response
(all statuses, all dates)
    ↓
Frontend Filter Logic (Applied in sequence)
    ├─ FILTER 1: Status Filter
    │  ├─ If user selected a specific status button
    │  │  └─ Show only that status
    │  └─ If default view (no button clicked)
    │     └─ Show only ["PENDING", "PARTIAL"]
    │
    ├─ FILTER 2: Date Filter (NEW)
    │  ├─ Calculate today at 00:00:00
    │  ├─ Compare each schedule's dueDate
    │  └─ Remove any schedule where dueDate < today
    │     └─ Keep all schedules where dueDate >= today
    │
    └─ Result: Filtered Data
       (Only PENDING/PARTIAL from today onwards in default view)
    ↓
Render in Table
```

### Filter Execution Order

1. **Status Filter (First)**
   - Removes OVERDUE/PAID or applies user's selection
2. **Date Filter (Second)**

   - Removes all past dates
   - Applied consistently regardless of status filter

3. **Other Filters (Third - Optional)**
   - Search
   - Amount range
   - Credit officer
   - Branch

## Accessing Historical Data

### Default View (No Historical Data)

```
Current behavior: Shows only today and forward
To see past schedules: Must use date range filter
```

### How to View Past Schedules

```
User clicks on date range filter
    ↓
Selects custom date range (e.g., Sept 1 - Sept 30)
    ↓
Status filter is temporarily overridden
    ↓
Shows PENDING/PARTIAL in selected date range
    ↓
Past schedules become visible
```

### Example: Accessing September Schedules

```
Default: Shows Oct 20+ (today onwards)

To view September:
  1. Click "Date Range" filter
  2. Select: Sept 1 - Sept 30
  3. Applies status filter to selected range
  4. Shows PENDING/PARTIAL from September
  5. All past items visible within that range
```

## Console Logs

When default view loads, you'll see:

```
🔍 Applying 'All Schedules' filter (showing PENDING and PARTIAL only)
📅 After excluding past schedules: X items (removed Y past items)
📊 After 'All Schedules' filter: X items
🎯 Final filtered data: [...]
📏 Final filtered count: X
```

When user clicks a specific status:

```
🔍 Applying specific status filter: OVERDUE
📅 After excluding past schedules: X items (removed Y past items)
📊 After status filter (OVERDUE): X items
🎯 Final filtered data: [...]
```

The console logs show how many past items were removed by the date filter.
