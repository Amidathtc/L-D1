# Document Upload Fix - Summary

## Problem Diagnosed ✅

Your documents are returning **404 errors** because:

1. Files were saved to Render's **ephemeral (temporary) storage**
2. When the app restarted, those files were deleted
3. Database records still exist, but the actual files are gone

## Solution Implemented ✅

### Changes Made to Backend

**File 1: `render.yaml`** - Added persistent disk configuration

```yaml
disk:
  name: document-storage
  mountPath: /var/data
  sizeGB: 10
```

**File 2: `src/controllers/document.controller.ts`** - Two changes:

1. Updated upload destination to use persistent disk
2. Improved error handling with better logging

## What Happens Next 🚀

### For New Documents (After Deployment)

- ✅ Uploaded documents save to `/var/data` (persistent)
- ✅ Persist across app restarts and redeployments
- ✅ Work perfectly forever

### For Old Documents

- ❌ Files are already deleted (ephemeral storage was wiped)
- ⚠️ Need to be deleted from database
- 🔄 Can be re-uploaded after deletion

## Action Required 📋

### 1. Push Code to GitHub

```bash
cd "c:\Users\Uche\Documents\David Millenium\L-D1"
git add -A
git commit -m "Fix: Add persistent disk for document storage"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Wait for Render Redeployment

- Check Render dashboard
- Wait 3-5 minutes for deployment to complete
- Persistent disk will be attached automatically

### 3. Delete Old Documents

Option A - Through UI:

- Go to customer detail page
- Delete old documents in Documents section

Option B - Through Database:

```sql
DELETE FROM "CustomerDocument" WHERE fileUrl LIKE 'uploads%';
DELETE FROM "LoanDocument" WHERE fileUrl LIKE 'uploads%';
```

### 4. Upload New Documents

- Upload documents through the UI
- They'll save to persistent disk
- Will work permanently ✅

### 5. Test

- Upload test document
- View it ✅
- Refresh page → Still there ✅
- App restarts → Still there ✅

## Files Changed

1. ✅ `render.yaml` - Added disk volume configuration
2. ✅ `src/controllers/document.controller.ts` - Updated file handling and error logging
3. ✅ Created documentation files for future reference

## Expected Outcome

After deployment and re-uploading documents:

| Action          | Result                       |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Upload document | Saves to persistent disk ✅  |
| View document   | Works immediately ✅         |
| App restarts    | Document persists ✅         |
| App redeployed  | Document persists ✅         |
| 30 days later   | Document still accessible ✅ |

## Estimated Time

- Push to GitHub: 1 minute
- Render redeployment: 3-5 minutes
- Delete old documents: 2-5 minutes
- Total: ~10 minutes to full functionality

## Questions?

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check Render dashboard deployment status
2. Check backend logs for file path debug info
3. Verify old documents are deleted before uploading new ones
4. Let me know what error message you see
