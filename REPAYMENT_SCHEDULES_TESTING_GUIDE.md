# Repayment Schedules: Testing & Verification Guide

## Quick Verification Steps (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Hard Refresh Browser

```
Windows/Linux: Ctrl + Shift + R
Mac: Cmd + Shift + R
```

This ensures you have the latest code with all fixes.

### Step 2: Navigate to Repayment Schedules

1. Go to Dashboard → Loan Payment → Repayment Schedules
2. Wait for data to load

### Step 3: Verify Default View

**Expected Results:**

- Table displays repayment schedules
- Shows "Showing 1 to 20 of 91+ results (API: server-side pagination)"
- "All Schedules" button is highlighted by default
- Page indicator shows "Page 1 of 5" (or more)

**Data Shown:**

- Mix of PENDING, PARTIAL, UNDER_REPAYMENT, and OVERDUE statuses
- NO PAID or FULLY_PAID schedules (correctly excluded)

### Step 4: Test Status Filter Buttons

#### Test 4a: Pending Button

```
✓ Click "Pending" button
✓ Should show "Showing 1 to 20 of 91 results"
✓ All items should have PENDING status
✓ Pagination: "Page 1 of 5"
✓ API should be called with ?status=PENDING
```

#### Test 4b: Partial Button

```
✓ Click "Partial" button
✓ Should show "Showing 1 to 2 of 2 results"
✓ All items should have PARTIAL status
✓ Pagination: "Page 1 of 1"
✓ API should be called with ?status=PARTIAL
```

#### Test 4c: All Schedules Button

```
✓ Click "All Schedules" button
✓ Should show "Showing 1 to 20 of 91+ results"
✓ Should see mixed PENDING, PARTIAL, UNDER_REPAYMENT statuses
✓ Pagination should reset to "Page 1 of 5"
```

### Step 5: Test Pagination

**Page Navigation:**

```
✓ Click "Next" → Page 2 should load items 21-40
✓ Click "Next" → Page 3 should load items 41-60
✓ "Previous" should be enabled on page 2+
✓ Page indicator updates correctly
```

**Items Per Page:**

```
✓ Change "Per page" dropdown to 50
✓ Should show "Showing 1 to 50 of 91 results"
✓ Pagination: "Page 1 of 2"
✓ Reset to page 1 automatically
```

### Step 6: Test Client-side Filters

```
✓ Search for customer name → Results reduce but pagination works
✓ Filter by credit officer → Results reduce but pagination works
✓ Filter by branch → Results reduce but pagination works
✓ Set amount range → Results reduce but pagination works
```

### Step 7: Verify No PAID Schedules

```
✓ Look through all pages
✓ Should NOT see any "Paid" status badges
✓ Should NOT see any "Fully Paid" status badges
✓ This is by design - paid schedules are hidden by default
```

## Detailed Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Complete Data Verification

**Objective:** Verify all data from API appears correctly

| Item                      | Expected | Status |
| ------------------------- | -------- | ------ |
| First page shows 20 items | ✓        | [ ]    |
| Total count is 91         | ✓        | [ ]    |
| Total pages is 5          | ✓        | [ ]    |
| Page 1: Items 1-20        | ✓        | [ ]    |
| Page 2: Items 21-40       | ✓        | [ ]    |
| Page 3: Items 41-60       | ✓        | [ ]    |
| Page 4: Items 61-80       | ✓        | [ ]    |
| Page 5: Items 81-91       | ✓        | [ ]    |

### Scenario 2: Status Filter Accuracy

**Objective:** Verify status filters work correctly

**PENDING Filter:**

- Expected: 91 total items, all PENDING status
- Navigate: Page 1-5
- Items shown per page: 20 each (last page 11)
- Verify: Each row shows PENDING badge

**PARTIAL Filter:**

- Expected: 2 total items, all PARTIAL status
- Pagination: Page 1 of 1
- Items shown: 2
- Verify: Each row shows PARTIAL badge

**UNDER_REPAYMENT Filter:**

- Expected: Shows all UNDER_REPAYMENT items
- Verify: Each row shows correct badge

**ALL SCHEDULES:**

- Expected: Mix of multiple statuses
- Should include: PENDING, PARTIAL, UNDER_REPAYMENT, OVERDUE
- Should exclude: PAID, FULLY_PAID

### Scenario 3: Pagination Edge Cases

**Objective:** Verify pagination handles edge cases

| Case              | Action             | Expected                 | Result |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------ | ------ |
| On Page 1         | Click Previous     | Previous button disabled | [ ]    |
| On Last Page      | Click Next         | Next button disabled     | [ ]    |
| Change rows to 50 | Page calculation   | Page 1 of 2              | [ ]    |
| Go to Page 5      | Change rows to 100 | Resets to Page 1 of 1    | [ ]    |

### Scenario 4: Search + Pagination

**Objective:** Verify client-side filters work with pagination

1. Search for "Tolani" (customer name from API)
   - Expected: Show matching schedules (multiple pages from LN00000008)
   - Pagination should show correct count
2. Search for "LN00000007" (loan number)

   - Expected: Show matching schedules
   - Verify pagination recalculates

3. Search for amount "5000"
   - Expected: Filter to items with due amount ~5000
   - Pagination updates correctly

### Scenario 5: Loan Status Verification

**Objective:** Verify only correct loan statuses are shown

From API data, these are included:

```
✓ PENDING_APPROVAL (LN00000008) - Should be shown
✓ APPROVED (LN00000007, LN00000006) - Should be shown
✓ ACTIVE (if any exist) - Should be shown
```

These should NOT be shown:

```
✗ COMPLETED
✗ CLOSED
✗ WRITTEN_OFF
✗ CANCELED
```

### Scenario 6: Mobile Responsiveness

**Test on Mobile (< 768px):**

```
✓ Table columns adjust properly
✓ Pagination controls are accessible
✓ Buttons are touch-friendly
✓ Status badges display correctly
✓ No horizontal scroll on critical columns
```

## Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still seeing only 20 items total

**Solutions:**

1. Clear browser cache: Ctrl+Shift+Delete
2. Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R
3. Check console (F12) for errors
4. Verify API is returning `pagination.total: 91`

### Issue: Pagination not working

**Solutions:**

1. Check total pages indicator
2. Verify API response has pagination object
3. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
4. Try different items per page settings

### Issue: "All Schedules" showing wrong items

**Solutions:**

1. Hard refresh to load new filter logic
2. Clear all filters (red button)
3. Check that OVERDUE status is included
4. Verify PAID items are excluded

### Issue: Search not filtering

**Solutions:**

1. Type slowly to ensure input captures
2. Try searching by loan number (e.g., "LN")
3. Check console for filter logic
4. Reload page and try again

### Issue: Browser console shows errors

**Copy and send:**

- Error message text
- Network tab: API response from `/api/repayments/schedules`
- React DevTools: Component props/state

---

## Browser Developer Tools Verification

### Check API Response (F12 → Network Tab)

```
Filter: /repayments/schedules
Request URL: https://l-d1.onrender.com/api/repayments/schedules?page=1&limit=50
Response Status: 200
Response Body should contain:
{
  "success": true,
  "pagination": {
    "total": 91,
    "totalPages": 5,
    "limit": 50
  }
}
```

### Check Console Logs (F12 → Console)

Look for logs like:

```
✅ INCLUDE: LN00000008#1 | LoanStatus: PENDING_APPROVAL | ScheduleStatus: PENDING
📊 After base filter: 50 items remaining
📊 Pagination data: { apiTotal: 91, apiTotalPages: 5 }
🎯 Final filtered data: 50 items
```

### Check React DevTools

1. Go to RepaymentSchedulePage component
2. Verify props:
   - `totalItems`: 91 (or more)
   - `totalPages`: 5 (or more)
   - `currentPage`: 1
   - `itemsPerPage`: 20
   - `filteredData`: Array of schedule objects

## Final Verification Command

Once all manual tests pass, verify with:

```bash
# In browser console
console.log({
  totalItems: document.querySelector('[class*="text-gray-600"]')?.textContent,
  pageInfo: document.querySelector('[class*="font-medium"]')?.textContent,
  rowCount: document.querySelectorAll('tbody tr').length,
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
})
```

Expected output:

```javascript
{
  totalItems: "Showing 1 to 20 of 91+ results (API: server-side pagination)",
  pageInfo: "Page 1 of 5",
  rowCount: 20,
  timestamp: "2025-10-20T..."
