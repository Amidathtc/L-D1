# TODAY & FORWARD DATE FILTER - CLIENT REQUIREMENT

**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Requirement:** Only repayment schedules from today and forward should show (no past or previous schedules)  
**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED

---

## Overview

A new date filter has been added to the repayment schedules page that automatically excludes all past repayment schedules. Users now see only schedules with due dates from today onwards.

---

## What Changed

### New Date Filter Added

**Purpose:** Prevent past/historical repayment schedules from showing in the default view

**When Applied:** Always active by default, cannot be disabled except by using date range filter

**Behavior:**

- Gets today's date at 00:00:00
- Compares each schedule's due date
- Removes any schedule where dueDate < today
- Keeps all schedules where dueDate >= today

### Before & After

**Before:**

- Table showed schedules from all dates (past, present, future)
- Users saw historical/old payment schedules
- Could view September 2025 schedules in October 2025

**After:**

- Table shows only schedules from today onwards
- All past dates are hidden
- Only current and future payment schedules visible
- Historical data still accessible via date range filter

---

## Implementation Details

### File Modified

`L-Dash/app/dashboard/business-management/loan-payment/repayment-schedules/page.tsx`

### Code Changes

#### New Date Filter (Lines 941-953)

Added after the status filter:

```typescript
// Filter out past repayment schedules - only show today and forward
// Per client request: no past or previous repayment schedules should show
const today = startOfDay(new Date());
const beforeFilter = filtered.length;
filtered = filtered.filter((item) => {
  const dueDate = startOfDay(new Date(item.dueDate));
  const isPastSchedule = dueDate < today;
  return !isPastSchedule; // Exclude past schedules
});
console.log(
  `📅 After excluding past schedules: ${filtered.length} items (removed ${
    beforeFilter - filtered.length
  } past items)`
);
```

### How It Works

1. **Get Today's Date**

   ```typescript
   const today = startOfDay(new Date());
   // Sets time to 00:00:00
   // Example: Oct 20, 2025 00:00:00
   ```

2. **Compare Each Schedule**

   ```typescript
   const dueDate = startOfDay(new Date(item.dueDate));
   // Normalize schedule's due date to 00:00:00
   ```

3. **Exclude Past Schedules**
   ```typescript
   const isPastSchedule = dueDate < today;
   return !isPastSchedule; // Keep only today and forward
   ```

---

## Filter Chain

Filters are applied in this order:

```
1. Status Filter
   ├─ Default: ["PENDING", "PARTIAL"]
   └─ Custom: Whatever user selected

2. Date Filter (NEW)
   ├─ Always active: dueDate >= today
   └─ Cannot be disabled in default view

3. Other Filters (Optional)
   ├─ Search
   ├─ Amount range
   ├─ Credit officer
   └─ Branch
```

## Examples

### Timeline View

**Today: October 20, 2025**

**NOT Shown (Past Dates):**

```
Oct 1:  PENDING ✗ (date is past)
Oct 5:  PARTIAL ✗ (date is past)
Oct 15: OVERDUE ✗ (date is past)
Oct 19: PAID ✗ (date is past)
```

**Shown by Default (Today Onwards):**

```
Oct 20: PENDING ✓ (today, PENDING status)
Oct 20: PARTIAL ✓ (today, PARTIAL status)
Oct 22: PENDING ✓ (future, PENDING status)
Oct 25: PARTIAL ✓ (future, PARTIAL status)
Nov 1:  PENDING ✓ (future, PENDING status)
Nov 10: PARTIAL ✓ (future, PARTIAL status)
```

**With Overdue Filter + Date Filter:**

```
Oct 22: OVERDUE ✓ (future OVERDUE)
Oct 25: OVERDUE ✓ (future OVERDUE)
(Past OVERDUE items still hidden)
```

### Combined Filters

**Default View:**

- Status: PENDING, PARTIAL only
- Date: Today onwards only
- Result: PENDING/PARTIAL from Oct 20+ only

**User Clicks "Overdue":**

- Status: OVERDUE only
- Date: Today onwards only (date filter still applied)
- Result: OVERDUE from Oct 20+ only

**User Clicks "Paid":**

- Status: PAID only
- Date: Today onwards only (date filter still applied)
- Result: PAID from Oct 20+ only

**User Sets Date Range (Sept 1 - Sept 30):**

- Status: PENDING, PARTIAL
- Date: Sept 1 - Sept 30 (overrides default)
- Result: Historical PENDING/PARTIAL visible

---

## User Experience

### Default Behavior

1. User navigates to Repayment Schedules
2. Page loads automatically with date filter applied
3. Only today's and future schedules visible
4. No configuration needed - happens by default

### Accessing Historical Data

If user needs to see past schedules:

1. Click on date range filter
2. Select custom date range (e.g., "Sept 1 - Sept 30")
3. Past schedules become visible
4. Return to default - past schedules hidden again

### Console Logs

You'll see debug information:

```
🔍 Applying 'All Schedules' filter (showing PENDING and PARTIAL only)
📅 After excluding past schedules: 45 items (removed 15 past items)
📊 After 'All Schedules' filter: 45 items
```

This shows that 15 past items were filtered out.
