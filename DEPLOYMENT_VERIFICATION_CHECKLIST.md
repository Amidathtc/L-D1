## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Default View

```
❌ BEFORE:
  - Oct 15 PENDING (past) ← Not wanted
  - Oct 19 OVERDUE (past) ← Not wanted
  - Oct 20 PENDING (today)
  - Oct 22 PARTIAL (future)
  - Oct 25 OVERDUE (future) ← Not wanted

✅ AFTER:
  - Oct 20 PENDING (today) ✓
  - Oct 22 PARTIAL (future) ✓
```

**Status:** ✅ Pass

### Scenario 2: Click "Overdue"

```
EXPECTED:
  - Oct 25 OVERDUE (future) ✓
  - Oct 30 OVERDUE (future) ✓

NOT SHOWN:
  - Oct 15 OVERDUE (past) ✗
  - Oct 19 OVERDUE (past) ✗
```

**Status:** ✅ Pass

### Scenario 3: Click "Paid"

```
EXPECTED:
  - Oct 20 PAID (today) ✓
  - Oct 25 PAID (future) ✓

NOT SHOWN:
  - Oct 15 PAID (past) ✗
```

**Status:** ✅ Pass

### Scenario 4: Date Range Filter (Historical)

```
USER SETS: Sept 1 - Sept 30

EXPECTED:
  - Shows historical September data
  - Sept 15 PENDING ✓
  - Sept 20 PARTIAL ✓
  - Sept 25 OVERDUE ✗ (OVERDUE excluded)

RETURN TO DEFAULT:
  - Past schedules hidden again
```

**Status:** ✅ Pass

### Scenario 5: Search + Filters

```
SEARCH: "John Smith"

EXPECTED:
  - John Smith's PENDING/PARTIAL from today onwards
  - Past John Smith schedules hidden
  - Other customers' schedules hidden
```

**Status:** ✅ Pass

### Scenario 6: Officer + Status Filter

```
OFFICER: "Officer-123"
STATUS: Click "Overdue"

EXPECTED:
  - Officer-123's OVERDUE schedules from today onwards
  - Other officers' schedules hidden
  - Past OVERDUE items hidden
```

**Status:** ✅ Pass

---

## Console Output Verification

### Expected Logs on Page Load

```
✅ Should see:
🔍 Applying 'All Schedules' filter (showing PENDING and PARTIAL only)
📅 After excluding past schedules: 45 items (removed 15 past items)
📊 After 'All Schedules' filter: 45 items
🎯 Final filtered data: [...]
📏 Final filtered count: 45
```

### Important: "Removed X past items" Count

- Should be > 0 if there are past schedules in data
- Shows date filter is working
- Helps debug if no data showing

## Browser Compatibility Testing

- [x] Chrome (latest)
- [x] Firefox (latest)
