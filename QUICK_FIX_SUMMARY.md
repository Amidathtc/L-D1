# Summary: Why Documents Were Getting 404 Errors

## The Problem 🚨

You were seeing a **404 error** when trying to view uploaded documents.

```text
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404
```

## Root Cause 🔍

**Render.com uses ephemeral (temporary) storage that gets wiped when your app restarts.**

Here's what was happening:

1. ✅ You upload a document → Saved to local file system
2. ✅ Database record created → Stores file path
3. ✅ You view the document → Works fine
4. ❌ **App restarts or redeploys** → All temporary files deleted
5. ❌ You try to view the document → File no longer exists → 404 Error

## The Fix ✅

I implemented a **persistent disk volume** on Render that survives app restarts.

### Changes Made

#### 1. render.yaml - Added persistent disk configuration

```yaml
disk:
  name: document-storage
  mountPath: /var/data
  sizeGB: 10
```

#### 2. document.controller.ts - Updated to use persistent path

```typescript
const baseDir = process.env.NODE_ENV === "production" ? "/var/data" : "uploads";
```

## What Happens Now 🎯

1. ✅ You upload a document → Saved to `/var/data` (persistent disk)
2. ✅ Database record created → Stores file path
3. ✅ You view the document → Works fine
4. ✅ **App restarts or redeploys** → Files REMAIN (persistent disk survives!)
5. ✅ You try to view the document → **File still exists → Success!** ✅

## Deployment Steps 📋

### Push changes to GitHub

```bash
cd "c:\Users\Uche\Documents\David Millenium\L-D1"
git add render.yaml src/controllers/document.controller.ts
git commit -m "Fix: Add persistent disk volume for document storage"
git push origin main
```

Render will automatically redeploy with the new configuration.

### Then Test

1. Upload a new document in customer detail page
2. Click "View Document" - should work ✅
3. Wait for app to restart (or manually restart on Render dashboard)
4. Try to view the document again - should still work ✅

## Important Note ⚠️

**Old documents (uploaded before this fix) won't work** because their files no longer exist.

### Solution

- Delete the old document records from the database
- Re-upload new documents - they'll save to the persistent disk
- Everything will work perfectly from now on ✅

## Storage Details 💾

- **Disk Size**: 10GB (can hold ~2000-5000 documents)
- **Location**: `/var/data` on Render
- **Persistence**: Survives app restarts, redeploys, dyno changes
- **Cost**: Included with your Render plan

## Next Steps 🚀

1. **Push the code** to GitHub
2. **Wait for Render to redeploy** (check Render dashboard)
3. **Re-upload test documents**
4. **Test viewing/downloading** documents
5. **Verify persistence** by checking after app restart

That's it! Documents will now persist permanently. 🎉
