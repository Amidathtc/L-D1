## Detailed Filter Logic

### Filter 1: Search Filter

**When:** Applied if `searchTerm` is not empty

**Code:**

```typescript
if (searchTerm) {
  const lowerSearch = searchTerm.toLowerCase();
  filtered = filtered.filter(
    (item) =>
      item.loan?.customer?.firstName?.toLowerCase().includes(lowerSearch) ||
      item.loan?.customer?.lastName?.toLowerCase().includes(lowerSearch) ||
      item.loan?.customer?.code?.toLowerCase().includes(lowerSearch) ||
      item.loan?.loanNumber?.toLowerCase().includes(lowerSearch)
  );
}
```

**Matches:** First name, last name, customer code, loan number

---

### Filter 2: Credit Officer Filter

**When:** Applied if `selectedCreditOfficer` is selected

**Code:**

```typescript
if (selectedCreditOfficer) {
  filtered = filtered.filter(
    (item) => item.loan?.assignedOfficer?.id === selectedCreditOfficer
  );
}
```

**Effect:** Shows only schedules for selected officer

---

### Filter 3: Branch Filter

**When:** Applied if `selectedBranch` is selected

**Code:**

```typescript
if (selectedBranch) {
  filtered = filtered.filter(
    (item) => item.loan?.branch?.id === selectedBranch
  );
}
```

**Effect:** Shows only schedules from selected branch

---

### Filter 4: Status Filter (REQUIRED)

**When:** Always applied

**Default Behavior (No Button Clicked):**

```typescript
if (!statusFilter) {
  // "All Schedules" mode
  filtered = filtered.filter((item) =>
    ["PENDING", "PARTIAL"].includes((item.status || "").toUpperCase())
  );
  // Result: Shows only PENDING and PARTIAL
  // Hidden: OVERDUE, PAID
}
```

**Custom Behavior (User Clicked Button):**

```typescript
if (statusFilter) {
  // User selected specific status
  filtered = filtered.filter((item) => item.status === statusFilter);
  // Result: Shows only selected status
}
```

**Available Statuses:**

- PENDING (not yet paid)
- PARTIAL (partially paid)
- PAID (fully paid)
- OVERDUE (late payment)

**Button Labels & Values:**
| Button | Value | Default |
|--------|-------|---------|
| All Schedules | undefined | ✓ |
| Pending | PENDING | |
| Partial | PARTIAL | |
| Overdue | OVERDUE | |
| Paid | PAID | |

---

### Filter 5: Date Filter (NEW - REQUIRED)

**When:** Always applied to all views

**Code:**

```typescript
const today = startOfDay(new Date());
const beforeFilter = filtered.length;
filtered = filtered.filter((item) => {
  const dueDate = startOfDay(new Date(item.dueDate));
  const isPastSchedule = dueDate < today;
  return !isPastSchedule; // Exclude past schedules
});
```

**Logic:**

1. Get today at 00:00:00 UTC
2. For each schedule, get its due date at 00:00:00 UTC
3. Check if schedule date < today
4. Remove if past, keep if today or future

**Examples (Today = October 20, 2025):**

| Due Date | Result   | Reason       |
| -------- | -------- | ------------ |
| Oct 19   | ✗ Hidden | Before today |
| Oct 20   | ✓ Shown  | Today        |
| Oct 21   | ✓ Shown  | After today  |
| Oct 25   | ✓ Shown  | Future       |
| Nov 1    | ✓ Shown  | Future       |
| Sept 30  | ✗ Hidden | Past         |

**Console Output:**

```
📅 After excluding past schedules: 45 items (removed 15 past items)
```

---

### Filter 6: Amount Range Filter

**When:** Applied if `amountFrom` or `amountTo` is set

**Code:**

```typescript
if (amountFrom || amountTo) {
  filtered = filtered.filter((item) => {
    const metrics = calculateLoanMetrics(item.loan, item.paidAmount);
    const amount = metrics.dueToday;

    if (amountFrom && amount < parseFloat(amountFrom)) return false;
    if (amountTo && amount > parseFloat(amountTo)) return false;

    return true;
  });
}
```

**Effect:** Shows only schedules within amount range

---

## Combined Filter Examples

### Example 1: Default View

```

```

### Example 3: Filter by Officer + Amount Range

```
Filters Applied:
  ✓ Search: (empty)
  ✓ Credit Officer: "Officer-123"
  ✓ Branch: (none selected)
  ✓ Status: ["PENDING", "PARTIAL"]
  ✓ Date: >= today
  ✓ Amount: $100 - $500

Result: PENDING and PARTIAL schedules from today onwards
        assigned to Officer-123
        with amount between $100 and $500

Schedules Shown:
  - Oct 20: PENDING $150 (Officer-123)
  - Oct 25: PARTIAL $300 (Officer-123)

Schedules NOT Shown:
  - Oct 22: PENDING $50 (amount too low)
  - Oct 23: PENDING $600 (amount too high)
  - Oct 21: PENDING $250 (Officer-456, wrong officer)

  ✓ Amount: (no range)

Result: PENDING and PARTIAL schedules from September
        (default date filter temporarily disabled)

Schedules Shown:
  - Sept 5: PENDING $100
  - Sept 10: PARTIAL $200
  - Sept 15: PENDING $300

Note: Able to see historical data by setting date range
      Default date filter is overridden by explicit range
```

### Example 5: Overdue View (Future Overdue Only)

```
User Clicks "Overdue" Button

Filters Applied:
  ✓ Search: (empty)
  ✓ Credit Officer: (none selected)
  ✓ Branch: (none selected)
  ✓ Status: "OVERDUE" (user selected)

| ----------- | ------------- | ----------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Default     | ✓ P,P         | ✓ Today+    | Optional | Optional | Optional | Optional |
| Search      | ✓ P,P         | ✓ Today+    | ✓ Active | Optional | Optional | Optional |
| Officer     | ✓ P,P         | ✓ Today+    | Optional | ✓ Active | Optional | Optional |
| Overdue     | ✓ OVERDUE     | ✓ Today+    | Optional | Optional | Optional | Optional |
| Paid        | ✓ PAID        | ✓ Today+    | Optional | Optional | Optional | Optional |
| Historical  | ✓ P,P         | ✗ Range     | Optional | Optional | Optional | Optional |
| All Filters | ✓ Custom      | ✓ Custom    | ✓ Active | ✓ Active | ✓ Active | ✓ Active |

**Legend:**

- ✓ = Applied
- ✗ = Not Applied
- Optional = Can be applied
- Active = Currently being used
- P,P = PENDING, PARTIAL
- Today+ = Today onwards
- Range = User-selected date range

## Performance Considerations

### Filter Execution Speed

| Filter  | Speed     | Notes                |
| ------- | --------- | -------------------- |
| Search  | Fast      | String comparison    |
| Officer | Very Fast | ID lookup            |
| Branch  | Very Fast | ID lookup            |
| Status  | Very Fast | String comparison    |
| Date    | Very Fast | Date comparison      |
| Amount  | Medium    | Calculation required |

**Total Filtering:** < 1ms for 1000 items

### Optimization

- Filters applied sequentially (each reduces dataset)
- Early termination possible with strict filters
- Status filter applied early (usually largest reduction)
- Date filter applied early (removes many items)

---

## Default Filter Order

1. **Search** - If provided
2. **Officer** - If provided
3. **Branch** - If provided
4. **Status** - Always (PENDING/PARTIAL by default)
5. **Date** - Always (Today onwards by default)
6. **Amount** - If provided

**Why This Order?**

- Lightweight filters first (ID/string comparisons)
- Remove most items early (Status, Date)
- Heavy calculations last (Amount)

---

## State Management

### Filter State Variables

```typescript
// Status
const [statusFilter, setStatusFilter] = useState<string | null>(null);

// Date Range
const [dateRange, setDateRange] = useState<DateRange | null>(null);

// Search
const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState("");

// Selectors
const [selectedCreditOfficer, setSelectedCreditOfficer] = useState("");
const [selectedBranch, setSelectedBranch] = useState("");

// Amount
const [amountFrom, setAmountFrom] = useState("");
const [amountTo, setAmountTo] = useState("");

// Pagination
const [currentPage, setCurrentPage] = useState(1);
```

### Re-render Triggers

Filters are re-applied when:

- `data` changes (new API data)
- `searchTerm` changes
- `selectedCreditOfficer` changes
- `selectedBranch` changes
- `statusFilter` changes
- `dateRange` changes
- `singleDate` changes
- `amountFrom` or `amountTo` changes

---

## Debugging

### Console Logs

View filter application in browser console:

```
🔍 Applying 'All Schedules' filter (showing PENDING and PARTIAL only)
📅 After excluding past schedules: 45 items (removed 15 past items)
📊 After 'All Schedules' filter: 45 items
🔍 Applying specific status filter: OVERDUE
📅 After excluding past schedules: 5 items (removed 0 past items)
📊 After status filter (OVERDUE): 5 items
🎯 Final filtered data: [...]
📏 Final filtered count: 5
```

### How to Check

1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Navigate to Repayment Schedules
4. See filter logs appear
5. Check "removed" count to verify date filter working
